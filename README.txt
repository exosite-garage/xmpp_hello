About
========================================
xmpp_hello is a collection of simple "hello world" programs that demonstrate
how to send data to the Exosite One Platform over XMPP.  

These programs are written in different languages so that they can be easily 
re-used by developers requiring different environments.

All source code is licensed under BSD so that it can be re-used with developer
code without necessitating open sourcing of the end-product source.  However,
we do hope that folks will push changes and improvements upstream.

========================================
Python
========================================
xmpp_hello in Python (./python folder) has been tested with Python 2.6.5
